<h4>Mission Statement</h4>
<p>To create a useful tool that can ease the translation of Java applications
for many people.</p> 

 
 <br>
<h4>Background</h4>

<p>In software projects, language translation is often done by non-developers.In 
Java, strings and other resources are often stored in resource bundles, that
is, a bunch of .properties files containing the same keys but different values.
These resource bundles aren't very friendly to the translator.

The solution is excelbundle. excelbundle is a little tool that converts these
resource bundles to Excel spreadsheets. Excel files are easier for
non-developers as they probably have Excel installed, and if not, they can use
OpenOffice.org or such.
When received back from the translator, excelbundle can merge the result back
into the source tree.</p>

<br>
<h4>Project Summary</h4>
<p>excelbundle uses Apache POI to read and write Excel spreadsheet and uses a
smart diff algorithm that only changes files with keys that have been changed to
make it compatible with popular version control systems.
All comments and newlines are retained in the properties files that already
exist as excelbundle doesn't use the default Java Properties class for writing.
</p><p>
Other features include:
<ul>
	<li>export only those keys which are untranslated</li>
	<li>create a completely new language that doesn't exist yet</li>
	<li>show statistics on how many keys/files that were
	    created/changed/deleted</li>
	<li>pretend mode that does no changes to files on disk but prints out
	    what would be done</li>
	<li>ant tasks to automate the exporting and importing</li>
	<li>excelbundle can map different keys to different sheets in the
	    workbook depending on what file or directory they're in</li>
</ul></p>
